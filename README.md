### Project Summary  
This project investigates how users interact with privacy policies, We sought to identify challenges in comprehension, engagement, and trust in recent times. By analyzing privacy policies from six Apps and surveying public perceptions, we provide insights into improving privacy policy design.  

### Problem Statement  
Privacy policies are often lengthy and filled with technical jargon, making them difficult for users to understand. Many individuals do not read or engage with privacy policies, leading to a lack of awareness about how their data is handled. Despite regulatory efforts like GDPR, transparency and accessibility issues persist.  

### Method
- **Analyzed six privacy policies** from entertainment and healthcare platforms to assess readability and transparency.  
- **Conducted a survey** with 30 participants to understand user engagement and perceptions of privacy policies.  
- Used tools like Flesch-Kincaid readability tests to measure policy complexity.  

### Key Findings  
- **Most privacy policies are too complex** for the average user to understand.  
- **79% of respondents prefer detailed policies**, but also want **simplified versions** for easier reading.  
- **33% of users rarely or never read privacy policies**, citing excessive length and lack of transparency.  
- **Trust in organizations is low**, with only **33% of participants believing companies follow their privacy policies**.  
- **Users are highly concerned about data sharing**, especially regarding **financial details, health data, and location tracking**.
